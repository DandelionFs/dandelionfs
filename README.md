Love code but not work......

Mostly I wanna code slowly and happily after I retired.

I wish I could insist to push log daily and code more things I've never seen. Meanwhile, I have to keep individual thinking, cause millions of AI wanna replace me myself and you guys except other people.

Fighting!!!
